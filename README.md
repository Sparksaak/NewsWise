How It Works
------------

NewsWise employs a multi-faceted approach to determine article authenticity:

1.  **Source Analysis:** Evaluates the reputation and historical accuracy of the news source.
    
2.  **Content Analysis:** Examines the article for common indicators of misinformation, such as sensational language, logical fallacies, and unsupported claims.
    
3.  **Cross-Referencing:** Compares information presented in the article with other reputable sources to identify discrepancies or corroborating evidence.
    
4.  **Bias Detection:** Identifies potential ideological or political biases within the content.
    

The authenticity score is a composite metric derived from these analyses, providing a comprehensive overview of the article's reliability. The summarization feature utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to extract the most salient points from the article.
